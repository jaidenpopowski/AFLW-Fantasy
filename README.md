# Optimal AFLW Fantasy teams

My code to find and display the optimal AFLW Fantasy starting teams for Season 7. Using position and ownership data collected prior to the season starting, we can find the best possible team to maximise total points and show how we could've won the overall prize.

I've also included an iteration where we maximise ownership numbers at Round 1 while still winning overall to pick more common players in a team.

Bench is currently not implemented - instead set to 5 basement priced ($28,700) players.
With automatic emergencies it would certainly be possible to improved the overall score by covering players like Chelsea Randall in R9/R10 or Georgie Prespakis in R6/R7. Stuck with the traditional structure of a playing ruck.
